My main passion is for everything Code, from web development to deep learning and all that is in-between. I started my career as a frontend developer, designing small web applications. I got really bored, very fast so I started looking at what I could do to challenge myself and along came Python. I have a consistent drive to master all levels of the stack and have recently been working on the operational stack (CI/CD, Infrastructure components and monitoring/logging) while playing around with some open source projects that I maintain or contribute to. The passion for understanding complexities has flowed into organisational and team structures and optimizing a teams culture and delivery.
